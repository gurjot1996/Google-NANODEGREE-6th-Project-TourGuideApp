#TourGuideApp
Tour Guide app. This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. For instance, an app focused on Mountain View, CA might include a list of startup headquarters as well as a list of restaurants and a list of parks.

Once you've decided on the location you'd like to show off, you'll want to build the structure of your app. Using the skills from the Miwok app, you'll make multiple screens, each containing a list. You may choose to use explicit intents to move between activities.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
Building layouts to display those lists of data.
Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
Creating your own custom classes.
Properly handling images or audio
